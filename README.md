## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yogavarshni Ramachandran

MS in Applied Data Science

ABOUT ME:

My journey into data science started in biomedical research, where I spent two years working on cancer studies. During that time, I realized how important computational biology was in making new discoveries. That experience made me curious about machine learning, and soon I found myself wanting to learn more about data and how it can be used to solve real problems.

After graduation, I joined Infosys and worked with AT&T, where I built my coding and development skills. While I enjoyed the technical side, I wanted to work closer to people and business decisions. That's when I moved to Freshworks, a B2B SaaS company, where I focused on customer success and sales analytics. There, I used data to help improve customer retention and drive business growth.

To strengthen my foundation, I pursued a Master's in Data Science. Alongside my studies, I worked as a Pricing Analyst intern at Discover Financial Services, applying data science to real-world problems in the financial industry.

My journey has been driven by curiosity, exploring data science from pipelines to models to business insights. Outside of work, I enjoy painting and conversations that spark creativity.
